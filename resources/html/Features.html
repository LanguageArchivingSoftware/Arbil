        <b>The following are known issues and areas under development</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The integration with Lamus has not yet begun so it is recommended to limit work to new corpus trees. Rather than editing files that already exist in a Corpus on the server</li>
            <li>The function to export for use in Lamus is not yet present </li>
            <!--<li>Resource images are not displayed when the application opens and remembers the previous windows.</li>-->
