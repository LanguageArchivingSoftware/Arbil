        Lamus is the gate keeper to the archive, it is required to validate all data 
        and file formats before anything can be added to the archive. For this reason
        once you have changes or new data ready you must upload it to the server via Lamus.<br>
        <br>
        The integration between Linorg and Lamus is in its early stages and for now
        you will need to export the modified files to then upload into Lamus.<br>
        <br>
        To export you changes select the modified nodes and via the mouse menu
        select export. You will then be offered a location dialog to chose the 
        location on your computer to export the files.<br>
