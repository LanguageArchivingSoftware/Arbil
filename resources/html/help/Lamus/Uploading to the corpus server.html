In order to upload your changes to the corpus server you must 
first export to disk then upload via Lamus.<br>
To export your new sessions and other changes, select the 
modified nodes or a branch that contains them all and 
via the mouse menu select export.
You will then be offered a location dialog to choose a 
location on your computer to export the files to.<br>
Lamus is then used to upload the exported files to the server. 
This process validates all data and file formats before 
anything is added to the archive.<br>
