Copy and paste can be used to move data between tables or between IMDI files.
When copying data from a table the format of the data will depend on what is selected. 
If fields or rows from multiple IMDI files are selected then the data cannot be pasted into the table.
It is only when fields from a single IMDI are selected that the data can be pasted into a table.
The destination table cells must match the field names of the originating data, 
which allows blocks of fields to be copied at the same time.

This provides the ability to paste multiple fields into multiple rows simultaneously.
