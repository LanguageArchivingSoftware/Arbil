You can either select the resource file from the "Working Directories" tree 
and drag it into the desired session. Or you can add a resource via the menu
"Add/WrittenResource" or "Add/MediaFile". However if you add via the menu rather 
than dragging you will then need to manually edit the location of the resource.<br>
<br>
Only some file types are archivable and this is indicated by the icons in 
the "Working Directories". If a file is not archivable then you will not be 
able to drag it into a session.<br>
