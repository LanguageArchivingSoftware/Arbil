        You can either start by adding to a copy of an existing corpus branch 
        on the server or you can create an unattached corpus branch to work in.<br>
        <br>
        To start working in an existing corpus you will need to select the 
        required branch in the "Remote Corpus" tree and make an off line copy 
        via the menu "Copy Branch to Offline Cache". The branch will then be copied
        into the "Local Corpus" tree. Once this is done you can work within the 
        "Local Corpus" tree adding new corpus branches or sessions, adding 
        resource files and adding new or editing existing metadata.<br>
        <br>
        To work in a new unattached corpus you will need to add a new corpus
        in the "Local Corpus" tree. This is done by selecting the "Local Corpus"
        tree and via the menu selecting "add/corpus". Once this is done you can 
        work within the newly created corpus adding new sessions etc..<br>
