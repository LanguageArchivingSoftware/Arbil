You can either start by creating an unattached corpus branch which can 
later be added to a corpus branch on the server or by making a copy of 
an existing corpus branch from the server. Either way, the files you 
create or edit will be on your computer not on the server. The changes 
or additions you make will only get to the server after you have 
uploaded them via Lamus.<br>

The Remote Corpus Tree is read only and is for viewing live data from 
the servers. It is from here that you can make an off line copy of an 
existing corpus branch.<br>

The Local Corpus Tree contains local files that you can create or edit.
It is here that any off line copies that you make can be accessed.<br>
<br>
Creating a new unattached corpus is done by selecting the "Local Corpus"
tree and via the context menu (right-click) selecting "add/corpus". Once this is done you can 
work within the newly created corpus adding new sessions etc..<br>
<br>
If you wish to start working in an existing corpus on of the servers you 
will need to select the required branch in the "Remote Corpus" tree and make 
an off line copy via the context menu (right-click) "Copy Branch to Offline Cache". The branch will 
then be copied into the "Local Corpus" tree. Once this is done you can work 
within the "Local Corpus" tree adding new corpus branches or sessions, adding 
resource files and adding new or editing existing metadata.<br>
<!--
To enter data you will need to either choose or create a session.<br>
Before you can create a session you will need to either:<br>
