A corpus branch can be created only in the 
<img align="center" src="../../icons/directory16x16.png"> 
"Local Corpus" tree or within 
another corpus branch in the "Local Corpus" tree.<br>
By right clicking where you would like it to be and selecting 
"Add/Corpus Branch" in the context menu (right-click) a new corpus branch will be created 
and opened in a table ready for editing.<br>
