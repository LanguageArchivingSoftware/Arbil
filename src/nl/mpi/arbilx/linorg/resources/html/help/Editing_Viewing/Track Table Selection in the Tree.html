The options menu contains an option for "Track Table Selection in the Tree". 
When selected the cell that is selected in the table will cause the the relevant 
branch to be selected in the either the Local Corpus or the Remote Corpus or the Working Directories. 
The context menu (right-click) for the table also contains an item "Jump to in Tree". 
This will also select the relevant branch in either the Local Corpus or the Remote Corpus or the Working Directories. <br>
This functionality is currently limited to branches in the tree that have already 
been opened since the Arbil was last started. This means that if a table has been 
reloaded from a previously saved state this may not function until the relevant 
branch is opened in the trees.
