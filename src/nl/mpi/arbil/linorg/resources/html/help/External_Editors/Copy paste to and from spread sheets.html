Copy and paste can be used to move data from Arbil to 
external editors such as a spread sheet or a text editor 
and then back into Arbil.<br>
When copying data from a table the format of the copied data will depend on 
what is selected; If multiple IMDI rows in a table are selected and copied 
the data format cannot be pasted back into Arbil,
however it can still be viewed and edited in an external editor.<br>
If cells in a table corresponding to a single IMDI are copied, then 
the data will be in a format that can then be pasted back into any 
table in Arbil, provided that the data maintains the same formatting.
For more information refer to "Copy paste between tables".
