        A corpus branch can be created only in the "Local Corpus" tree or within 
        another corpus branch in the "Local Corpus" tree.<br>
        By right clicking where you would like it to be and selecting 
        "Add/Corpus Branch" in the menu a new corpus will be created and opened 
        in a table ready for editing.<br>
