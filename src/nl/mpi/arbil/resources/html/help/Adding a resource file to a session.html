        You can either select the resource file in the "Working Directories" tree 
        and drag it into the desired session.<br>
        Or you can add a resource via the menu "Add/WrittenResource" or "Add/MediaFile" 
        and then manually edit the location of the resource.<br>
        <br>
        Only some file types are archivable and this is indicated by the icons in 
        the "Working Directories". If a file is not archivable then you will not be 
        able to drag it into a session.<br>
