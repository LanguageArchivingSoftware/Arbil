        A session can be created only within a corpus branch in the 
        "Local Corpus" tree.<br>
        By right clicking the corpus branch where you would like it to be added 
        and selecting "Add/Corpus Session" in the menu a new session will be 
        created and opened in a table ready for editing.<br>
