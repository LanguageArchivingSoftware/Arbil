Arbil is an application for arranging research material and associated 
metadata into a format appropriate for archiving.<br>
<br>
Arbil is designed so that it can be used off line in remote locations.
The data can be entered at any stage in part or as a whole. When an 
internet connection is available the work can then be transferred to 
the main archive via Lamus.<br>
