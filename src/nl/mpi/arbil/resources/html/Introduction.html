        <b>Linorg is a local metadata organising tool for researchers.</b><br>
        Corpus can be cached locally and new data added while off line.<br>
        This application is still in development so some areas are incomplete.<br>
        <p>
            <B>There are five main areas in the application:</B>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Top left tree listing contains remote corpus</li>
                <li>Middle left tree listing will contain off line copies of corpus</li>
                <li>Bottom left tree listing lists local directories</li>
                <li>Top right shows a preview of any selected IMDI</li>
                <li>Bottom right is where IMDI files can be viewed and edited</li>
