A session can be created only within the 
<img align="center" src="../../icons/directory16x16.png"> "Local Corpus"
tree or a <img align="center" src="../../icons/corpusnode_color.png"> 
"corpus branch" within the "Local Corpus".<br>
By right clicking the local corpus branch where you would like it to be added 
and selecting "Add/Session" in the context menu (right-click) a new session will be 
created and opened in a table ready for editing.<br>
