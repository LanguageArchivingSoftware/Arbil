It is possible to override the default set of filetypes that the type checker 
should recognize as archivable resources.<br />
To do so, place your custom <strong><em>filetypes.txt</em></strong> configuration 
file in the root of your local storage directory (to find out what that is, select 
<strong>Local Corpus Storage Directory</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> menu). 
It will then automatically be installed in the type checker as soon as type checking takes place for the 
first time during a session. You will need to restart Arbil if it is already running.<br /><br />
For information about obtaining or creating a custom filetypes configuration, please contact your administrator.
