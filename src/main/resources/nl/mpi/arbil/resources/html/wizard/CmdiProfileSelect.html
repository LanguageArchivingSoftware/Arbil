<h2>Select your CMDI profiles</h2>
<p>
    Please select the CMDI profiles that you wish to use.<br>
    You can always change your selection by selecting 'Templates/Profiles' from the Options menu.

<p>
    Select the profiles you would like to start using from the list below. If this is the first time<br>
    you run this Wizard, the profiles will have to be download first. In this case, it will take some<br>
    time before the list appears.

    If you hover over any one of the profile names, you will see a description of that profile.
