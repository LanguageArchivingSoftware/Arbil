<p>
One or more sessions in the local corpus can be moved into an existing corpus by selecting the sessions and then dragging them onto
the desired corpus node in the local corpus tree. A dialog will appear for confirmation. 
</p>

<p>
In the case of moving multiple sessions,
it is possible to confirm the entire operation by selecting 'Move all', or do so for each individual session by selecting 'Move' or 
optionally skip individual sessions by selecting 'Skip'. 'Abort' will abort the entire move operation (but not undo any preceding moves).
