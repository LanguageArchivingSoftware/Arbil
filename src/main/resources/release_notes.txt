** FIXES **

Among other, mostly minor, bugfixes, the following issues have been resolved:

- SAVING TO DISK: In particular (rare) instances, saving the XML to disk failed 
resulting in empty document. This was due to a bug in one of the used
libraries. (#1431)

- WINDOWS: The 'Templates and Profiles' and 'Edit IMDI Language List' dialog windows
could grow larger than the available screen space. (#147 and #1584)

** KNOWN ISSUES **

Among others, the following issues have been described and will be addressed in future version of
Arbil:

- IMPORT RESOURCES: Resources that are protected and require authentication can currently not be
imported into the local corpus since the authentication mechanism is broken. (#679)

- SHOW IMDI FORMATTED: When showing an IMDI metadata file 'IMDI formatted', the formatting does
not look as expected. (#899)

- PERFORMANCE: After importing (certain) corpus nodes, CPU load gets and stays high. (#929)

- STABILITY: During search, memory usage may exceed the limits of the Java virtual machine which
could cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.

- SEARCH IN TABLE: The layout of the input boxes for search/replace within a table sometimes break
on Windows and Linux. (#1577)

- REMOTE SEARCH: The search interface for remote search is not very intuitive. At the moment remote
search requires two steps: remote searching and local filtering. (#651)

- FILE HANDLING: There are some issues with file handling that occur on Windows 7. These can cause
opening in external file and moving the local corpus directory to fail. (#1372 and #1553)
