    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Arbil is an application for arranging research material and associated metadata into a
      format appropriate for archiving. </para>
    <para>Arbil is designed so that it can be used off line in remote locations. The data can be
      entered at any stage in part or as a whole. When an internet connection is available the work
      can then be transferred to the main archive via Lamus.</para>
    <section id="Sec_General_Information">
      <title>General Information</title>
      <para/>
      <para>Two steps are required in adding a corpus to the MPI Archive. The first involves
        creating the corpus, editing the metadata and converting it into an archivable format using
          <emphasis role="bold">ARBIL</emphasis>(Archive Builder) while the second involves
        exporting the created/edited corpus to the archive using <emphasis role="bold"
          >LAMUS</emphasis> .</para>
      <para>This manual describes in detail the first step i.e. <emphasis role="bold"
          >Arbil</emphasis>. For the second step, <emphasis role="bold">Lamus</emphasis>, please
        refer to the <ulink url="http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/lamus/">LAMUS manual</ulink>). </para>
      <para>The MPI Archive can ONLY accept corpora which are in the .IMDI format. By creating a
        corpus through Arbil, you create an IMDI file ready to be exported to the Archive. </para>
      <para> Arbil allows you to view all the corpora in the Archive or any other remote location
        (provided you have access rights).</para>
      <para>Corpora from the archive can also be edited through Arbil. If the changes are to be
        implemented they have to go through <emphasis role="bold">Lamus</emphasis>.</para>
      <para/>
      <para> In short, Arbil allows you to: </para>
      <para>1) View the Archive</para>
      <para>2) Import metadata from the Archive &amp; edit.</para>
      <para>3) Create new corpora, with new metadata and media files.</para>
      <para>4) Export the IMDI files, ready to be archived</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Changes you make to corpora imported from the Archive will <emphasis role="underline"
            ><emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis></emphasis> affect the Archive directly, as Arbil
        merely allows you to make changes on a <emphasis role="bold">local level</emphasis>, and not
        to the Archive itself. If you want to upload your changes to the archive, you must export
        them to LAMUS, which in turn, allows you to submit corpora into the archive.</para>
      <para>Arbil is the next generation of the <emphasis role="bold">IMDI</emphasis> Editor with a
        more powerful user interface and functionality. This manual contains detailed information on
        how to use Arbil: create new corpus structures/session nodes, and modify existing corpora.
        It does not explain the internal structure of IMDI (for more information on the IMDI
        metadata set, please see <ulink url="http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/imdi/">the LAT
          website</ulink>).</para>

        Guide</ulink>.</para>
      <para>We encourage you to provide feedback, comments, and suggestions so that we can improve
        the documentation to better meet your needs. Also, in case of problems that are not

    <section id="Sec_Overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>The way you start working on your data is twofold: </para>
      <para>a) you either create a new corpus or </para>
      <para>b) make a copy of an already existing corpus or its branch from the server and edit it.
        Either way, the files you create/edit will be saved on your computer (in the so called
          <emphasis role="bold">Local Corpus</emphasis>). This enables you to work off-line in
        remote locations while still in the field. Changes you make in Arbil will <emphasis
          role="underline">not</emphasis> affect the archive.</para>
      <para>Arbil consists of 6 working areas as shown in the figure below:</para>
      <para>- 1) <emphasis role="bold">The Menu Bar</emphasis> allows you to access the main
        commands </para>
      <para>- 2) <emphasis role="bold">The</emphasis>
        <link linkend="Sec_Remote_Corpus"><emphasis role="bold">Remote Corpus</emphasis></link>
        contains locations from the Language Archive. This is where you can view corpora and choose
        to import.</para>
      <para>- 3) <emphasis role="bold">The</emphasis>
        <link linkend="Sec_Local_Corpus"><emphasis role="bold">Local Corpus</emphasis></link>
        contains the user's main working area. This is where corpora from the Remote Corpus can be
        imported and edited. It's also used for creating new corpora.</para>
      <para>- 4) <emphasis role="bold">The</emphasis>
        <link linkend="Sec_Working_Directories"><emphasis role="bold">Files /Favourites (Working
            Directories)</emphasis></link>. This is where you can link directories from your
        computer to Arbil in order to import media files and create favourite metadata items.</para>
      <para>- 5) <emphasis role="bold">The Preview Area </emphasis>shows metadata of the selected
        node (In the figure below, it displays the details for "New Corpus"). It changes every time
        a new node is selected.</para>
      <para>- 6) <emphasis role="bold">The Table Area</emphasis> is where several nodes can be
        opened, compared, and modified at the same time (In the figure below, the three nodes from
        the Local Corpus are placed in a table in this area)</para>
      <para>Note: You can customise the size of these panes. To make a window larger or smaller
        place the pointer on the border and drag it in the direction in which you want the window to
        expand or contract. It is also possible to hide the preview area by unchecking the <emphasis
          role="italic">show selection preview</emphasis> from the <emphasis role="italic"
          >options</emphasis> menu.</para>

      <title>Work flow</title>
      <para>When working with Arbil, you have to decide whether you are going to <link
          linkend="Sec_Remote_Corpus" role="bold">work on an existing corpus from the Remote
          Corpus</link> or <link linkend="Sec_New_Corpora" role="bold">create a new corpus</link>.
        Assuming that you intend to edit metadata in the Archive and add additional media files, you
        follow the steps 1-6 below. </para>
      <para>The Arbil work flow for editing a corpus is as follows:</para>
      <para>1) Browse the Remote Corpus and locate the corpus which you intend to edit; drag it from
        the Remote Corpus pane into the Local Corpus pane so as to import it. </para>
      <para>2) Now that the corpus is located in the Local Corpus, you may edit it freely. To edit
        the metadata, drag the node into the Table Area (6, image 1.1 ) and edit the fields
        accordingly (editing can also be done in an external editor). This can be done with several
        corpora/sessions at once.</para>
      <para>3) In order to add resources to sessions (e.g. media files and annotations), you must
          <link linkend="Sec_Working_Directories">set up a working directory</link> which links a
        folder on your computer to Arbil. This means that any media files in this folder will appear
        in the Working directory area so that <link linkend="Sec_Adding_Resource_Files" role="bold"
          >Resource files can be added</link> to the sessions of a corpus in your Local Corpus. To
        add files to your new corpus, drag and drop them from the <emphasis role="italic"
          >files</emphasis> to the <emphasis role="italic">local corpus </emphasis>. Now you can
        edit the metadata following step 2.</para>
      <para>4) Stored session elements, such as common actors, can be added to the local corpus from
        the <emphasis role="italic">favourites</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>5) Once your metadata have been edited correctly and your desired media files have been
        added to your sessions, you can export the metadata files to a directory (folder) on your
        computer.</para>
      <para>In order to create a new node, add a node in the Local Corpus and follow the same
        steps.</para>
      <para>Note: This is as far as you can get using Arbil. </para>
      <para>6) Once the work is finished, Open <ulink url="http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/lamus/"
          >Lamus</ulink> and import the directory (folder) which contains the corpora. It will then
        be <link lang="" linkend="Sec_Favourites">uploaded to the archive</link>.</para>
      <para>Corpus and session nodes are easily edited directly in Arbil (see <link
          linkend="Ch_Editing_Corpus_Structure">chapter 4</link> and <link
          linkend="Ch_Editing_Metadata">chapter 5</link>) but they can also be worked on in an <link
          linkend="Sec_Favourites">external editor</link> (such as Microsoft Excel or another
        spreadsheet program) see <link linkend="Sec_using_an_external_editor">7.3</link>. </para>

      <para>In Arbil all work on corpora and sessions takes place in the Local Corpus tree. The
        various import, export, and edit operations displayed in the figure above, can usually be
        triggered by right-clicking on elements in the Local Corpus, or via "drag and drop" (e.g..
        clicking on an element in the Remote Corpus, holding the mouse key, and dragging the element
        to the Local Corpus, or to a corpus node within the Local Corpus). Media files (i. e. audio
        and video recordings) and written resources can also be added to sessions via "drag and
        drop" from the Working Directories tree in the Files tab. Only for importing previously
        exported sessions to the local corpus root one has to access the File menu in Arbil's menu
        bar. </para>

    <title>Starting Arbil</title>
    <para>When you open Arbil for the first time the <emphasis role="italic">wizard</emphasis>
      appears and gives you the ability to configure Arbil to your needs. The first window is a
      welcome window, press <emphasis role="italic">next</emphasis> to move to the second step of
      the wizard. In this window you select the metadata format i.e. IMDI or CMDI; you can choose
      one of them or both. In this manual we will assume just IMDI. The third window gives you the
      ability to choose the corpora that will appear in the <emphasis role="italic">Remote
        corpus</emphasis> box. If you know the URL<footnote id="fn_url">
        <para>You can copy the URL of a corpus by selecting the node in the remote tree in Arbil
          when the wizard is not showing, right click and select 'Copy'; or get it from the IMDI
          browser by navigating to the corpus, right click the node and select 'Create bookmark' and
          copy the URL link. Then you can paste it into the box in the wizard.</para>
      </footnote> of a corpus that you will be working on frequently, you can add it to this list so
      that it will be available on the root level of the tree in the <emphasis role="italic">Remote

        under each <emphasis role="italic">corpus node</emphasis><inlinegraphic
          fileref="images/corpus_branch_icon.png"/> . These nodes do not describe resources but are
        meant to construct the corpus structure only. It is the<emphasis role="italic"> session
          nodes</emphasis><inlinegraphic fileref="images/session_icon.png"/> which include
        information about the actors, content, media file, project, source and written

      <para>A <emphasis role="italic">corpus catalogue,</emphasis><inlinegraphic
          fileref="images/catalogue_icon.png" contentdepth="80%"/> on the other hand, is a general

    </section>
    <section id="Sec_Remote_Corpus">
      <title>Remote Corpus</title>
      <para>The Remote Corpus contains all the corpora located in the archive. Currently it is not
        possible to <emphasis role="underline">add </emphasis>anything to the remote corpus or edit
        it in general. It is primarily used to view data and also allows you to import corpora to
        the Local corpus (discussed in <link linkend="Sec_Import_to_Local_Corpus">Section
        3.3</link>) where they can then be modified.</para>
      <para>It has a tree-like structure in which each node contains multiple sub-branches. To open
        any of them, click on the bullet to the left of the node representing the branch or double
        click the node itself. This can be repeated for the sub-branches as well. In this way you
        can view the whole structure of the corpus. If you click the bullet again, the node will
        fold back (the Remote Corpus is very similar in use to <ulink url="http://corpus1.mpi.nl/">

        <para>Since you might not want to use all of the corpora in the Remote Corpus, it is also
          possible to remove any of the locations of the Remote Corpus at the root level so as to
          only display the corpora that you need. This can be done at the root level only (see
          figure 3.1) by right clicking on the node (e.g. for MPI corpora) and selecting <emphasis

          appear in the Remote Corpus tree. </para>
        <para/>
        <para>The corpus data on the Remote Corpus are frequently updated by researchers. To be sure
          that you are working with the newest version of the available data, you can update it
          manually on the nodes that you believe have been altered. To do this, right click on the
          specific corpus/session you want to update and select <emphasis role="italic"
            >Reload</emphasis>. In principle, after new data has been entered into the archive, it
          can take up to an hour before the Archive is updated.</para>

        <para>In general, the easiest way to view the information of a node is to drag and drop it
          from the remote corpus into the grey working area on the bottom right. It is also possible
          to right click on the selected node and choose<emphasis role="italic">View
            Selected</emphasis>. In either case, a window pops up with the desired information
          listed in tables. This can also enable you to view multiple nodes at the same time. </para>
        <para>To compare <emphasis role="italic">multiple</emphasis> nodes, simply hold Ctrl while
          clicking on the desired nodes. Then drag them to the working area (or right click and
          select <emphasis role="italic">View selected)</emphasis>. You will get a similar scenario
          to this displayed in the figure (3.2) below.</para>
        <para>Note: If you have an existing open table, it is also possible to add additional tree
          nodes of any form (i.e. sessions, corpora and files). Simply drag any unselected node from
          the tree structure and drop it on the table. It will be automatically added to the table
          as a row.</para>

        <para>There are also two other quick ways for viewing  corpus/session information. </para>
        <para>(1) Let your cursor rest above a corpus or session node without clicking. Information
          about the corpus/session will be displayed in the tooltip under the cursor.</para>
        <para>(2) Click on a corpus/session node. Information will be shown up in the top right
          frame. </para>
        <para/>
        <para>When viewing information on multiple corpora, each row corresponds to one corpus,
          while each column corresponds to one metadata element (data category). By clicking on any
          of the column names, you can easily sort rows alphabetically within a given table.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>In a table that includes several different types of nodes (such as sessions and corpus
          nodes as listed in the table below) notice that not all the elements of the corpus
          structure are described in terms of the same data categories (column); for example, there
          are data categories that belong to a session but not to a corpus node. Such data fields
          are marked in grey and are not available this is also the case in the Local corpus (<link

          category for this particular node. To see these values click on &lt;multiple values&gt;

        header of a column. When chosen, this mode will freeze the current columns view, meaning
        that no matter what element you add to the window, only the current categories (columns)
        will be shown.</para>
      <para>It is also possible to set the width of the columns by dragging the right or left edge
        of the column. This applies to arbitrary open tables as well as saved column views.</para>

      <title>Importing data into Arbil</title>
      <para>In Arbil there is a number of possibilities to import the data. The first way to import
        data is from the Remote corpus to the Local corpus by right clicking on the remote corpus
        and selecting import to local corpus, or by "drag and drop". </para>
      <para>In the case you want to import data from you local computer disk, or the network, you
        can do this from the  menu bar by going to <emphasis role="italic">Files</emphasis>,
          <emphasis role="italic">Import</emphasis> and then selecting the data from your local
        disk, or the network; your data is imported at the root level. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">Import Branch</emphasis> (i.e.. importing a piece of your
        corpus) gives you the ability to import part of your corpus from your disk to the Local
        corpus. <emphasis role="italic">Reimport</emphasis> (i.e.. re-importing form the remote
        corpus): in order to make changes to a corpus you have already exported to the Remote corpus
        via Lamus it is essential to reimport it to the Local corpus and select <emphasis
          role="italic">overwrite changes</emphasis>. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">Import CSV</emphasis> (i.e. in the table format) gives you the
        ability to import edited data in the Local corpus in the form of a table (for details see

      <title id="Sec_using_an_external_editor">Using an External Editor</title>
      <para>As has been noted already, it is possible to open, view and modify the data using
        external editors such as spread sheets or text editors. Overall the process is done by
        moving data from Arbil to the external editor, making the necessary changes, and then moving
        them back to Arbil. </para>
      <para>Moving data back to Arbil however posses some restrictions; for example, if you copy
        multiple rows in a table, the data format cannot be pasted back into Arbil. However it can
        still be viewed and edited in an external editor. For this reason after editing data in an
        external editor, such as Microsoft Excel, you can save you your data in csv format, and then
        import them to Arbil by right clicking on the preferred node and selecting <emphasis
          role="italic">import CSV</emphasis>. This way gives you the ability to import the data in
        a table format; in any other case you will have to import the edited data column by column,
        but not all at once.</para>
      <para>If cells in a table corresponding to a single metadata file are copied, then the data
        will be in a format that can then be pasted back into any table in Arbil, provided that the
        data maintains the same formatting.</para>
      <para>To open data in an external editor i.e. Ms Excel, select and copy the data from the
        table , then paste them in the editor you wish to use.</para>

      <title>Custom Filetypes Configuration</title>
      <para>It is possible to override the default set of filetypes that the type checker should recognize as archivable resources.</para>
      <para>To do so, place your custom filetypes.txt configuration file in the root of your local storage directory (to find out what that is, select Local Corpus Storage Directory from the Options menu). It will then automatically be installed in the type checker as soon as type checking takes place for the first time during a session. You will need to restart Arbil if it is already running.</para>

      <title>Templates</title>
      <para>Templates are currently in development, but they will be used to customise the components added via the "Add" menu.</para>
      <para>To create a new template, create a directory in the ".arbil/templates" directory. This is where all the files relevant to that template will be stored. This directory will now be selectable via the "options/templates" menu.</para>
      <para>Each template can have its own XSL which is used via the "view formatted" menu. The XSL must be in the selected templates directory and be called "format.xsl". For example: .arbil/templates/{template name}/format.xsl. If there are any additional files required by the XSL they can be placed in the same directory as the XSL file.</para>
