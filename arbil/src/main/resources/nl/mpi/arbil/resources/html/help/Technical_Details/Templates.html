Templates are currently in development, but they will be used to customise the 
components added via the "Add" menu.<br>
To create a new template, create a directory in the ".arbil/templates" directory.
This is where all the files relevant to that template will be stored. This directory 
will now be selectable via the "options/templates" menu.<br>
Each template can have its own XSL which is used via the "view formatted" menu.
The XSL must be in the selected templates directory and be called "format.xsl".
For example: .arbil/templates/{template name}/format.xsl. If there are any additional
files required by the XSL they can be placed in the same directory as the XSL file.<br>
