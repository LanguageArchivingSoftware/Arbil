When multiple nodes are displayed in the table, the sub nodes can also be displayed in a table cell.
To do this, select the relevant row in the table and via the context menu (right-click) 
select the "Show Child Nodes" option. Once one of the available child node types is 
selected that child type will be added as a column in the table.
