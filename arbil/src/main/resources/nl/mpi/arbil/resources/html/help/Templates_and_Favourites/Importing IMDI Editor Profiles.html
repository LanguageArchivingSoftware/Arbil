To import metadata elements from the "Local Repository" of the IMDI Editor you
will need to create an IMDI file from within the IMDI Editor containing the
relevant elements (Actors etc.) and save that IMDI file to disk. The directory
containing this IMDI file can then be added as a "Working Directory" in Arbil.
Once this IMDI file is visible in Arbil any of it's elements (Actors etc.) can
be added as a Favourite in Arbil.<br>
<br>
Alternatively a Favourite can be created from any IMDI file even those already 
in the archive. This is done by selecting the desired node and adding it to
Favourites via the context menu. 

<!--
If you are wanting to use your existing the imdi editor templates then you should
create an imdi file in the imdi editor so that it contains all the elements (actors etc.)
that you need. The resulting imdi file should then be put into one of your working directories.
Then you can select and add each of the actors as favourites in Arbil.
