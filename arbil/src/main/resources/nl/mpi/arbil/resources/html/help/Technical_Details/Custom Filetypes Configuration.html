It is possible to override the default set of filetypes that the type checker 
should recognize as archivable resources.<br />

To do so, place your custom <strong><em>filetypes.txt</em></strong> configuration 
file in the root of your local storage directory (to find out what that is, select 
<strong>Local Corpus Storage Directory</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> menu). 
It will then automatically be installed in the type checker as soon as type checking takes place for the 
first time during a session. You will need to restart Arbil if it is already running.<br /><br />

For information about obtaining or creating a custom filetypes configuration, please contact your administrator.<br/><br />

Notice that types that have already been typechecked will not be re-checked. Therefore, the new 
configuration will only apply to newly encountered files. To force re-checking, on an existing installation, quit Arbil, go to the 
Arbil working directory (<em>.arbil</em>) and remove the files <em>knownMimeTypesV2</em>, <em>pathToMd5Sums</em> and 
<em>processedFilesMTimesV2</em>.
