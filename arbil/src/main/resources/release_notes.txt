** ADDITIONS **

The following functionality has been added to Arbil:


** CHANGES **

These parts of the Arbil functionality have changed:

- CMDI PROFILES: Profiles are no longer downloaded automatically along with the profiles list. They
get downloaded as soon as they are selected, or alternatively all profiles can be downloaded 
through a new 'Download all profiles' button in the profiles panel of the templates dialog. (#1412)

- STORAGE DIRECTORY: When multiple storage directories are detected, the user is notified through
a warning dialog. (#1246)

** FIXES **

Among other, mostly minor, bugfixes, the following issues have been resolved:

- PROFILES DIALOG: After (re)loading profiles, the window would be resized to a size that exceeds 
the screen limits. This has been fixed. (#147)

** KNOWN ISSUES **

Among others, the following issues have been described and will be addressed in future version of
Arbil:

- IMPORT RESOURCES: Resources that are protected and require authentication can currently not be
imported into the local corpus since the authentication mechanism is broken. (#679)

- SHOW IMDI FORMATTED: When showing an IMDI metadata file 'IMDI formatted', the formatting does
not look as expected. (#899)

- PERFORMANCE: After importing (certain) corpus nodes, CPU load gets and stays high. (#929)

- STABILITY: During search, memory usage may exceed the limits of the Java virtual machine which
could cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.
