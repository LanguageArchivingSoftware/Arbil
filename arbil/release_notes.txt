----------------------------------------

Below is an overview of changes in Arbil since the previous minor version (Arbil
2.4). Where applicable, related ticket numbers from TRAC are included at the end
of the description.

** ADDITIONS **

The following functionality has been added to Arbil:

- FAVOURITES: Favourites can be now be imported and exported. (#19)

- TYPE CHECKING: Typechecking can be forced on a resource manually through a
menu option. (#2826)

- TABLE: Nodes and fields can be deleted from the table view. (#1276)

- MENU BAR: A view menu has been added to the menu bar with menu options
to change the font size throughout the application. (#1981)

- TREE STRUCTURE VIEW: It is possible to switch to a verbatim representation
of the document structure in the tree for CMDI documents through an item
in the 'Options' menu. (#1153)

- REMOTE CORPUS TREE: A context menu option to add any selected remote node
to the root of the 'Remote Corpus' tree is now available. (#1692)

** CHANGES **

These parts of the Arbil functionality have changed:

- FAVOURITES: Favourites are now grouped by type. (#21)

- CMDI PROFILES: Profiles are no longer downloaded automatically along with the
profiles list. They get downloaded as soon as they are selected, or
alternatively all profiles can be downloaded through a new 'Download all
profiles' button in the profiles panel of the templates dialog. (#1412)

- CMDI PROFILES: The name of manually added profiles now gets retrieved from
the profile schema, so that their full name gets displayed instead of a name
derrived from the schema location. (#1470)

- STORAGE DIRECTORY: When multiple storage directories are detected, the user is
notified through a warning dialog. (#1246)

- EDITING: Typing in a field will replace the existing content by default. The
user can append to the existing content by using the mouse or one of the 
keyboard shortcuts F2 or CTRL-U. (#1245)

- LANGUAGE SELECTION: Selection of all languages from the IMDI language
vocabulary will be updated as new languages get added. (#2317)

- SEARCH RESULTS: Columns matching a search term get highlighted in the
search result table. If a single node is returned as a search result, it is 
shown as a single row instead of a vertical table. (#1170, #1273)

- IMPORT/EXPORT: When importing or exporting metadata will hit an existing
copy of a file, a dialogue is now shown asking the user whether to overwrite
or not. (#1272, #1403)

- NODE LOADING: Nodes only loaded for tree display purposes do not get fully
processed. This increases performance, especially with large collections of
CMDI files. (#1755, #1797)

** FIXES **

Among other, mostly minor, bugfixes, the following issues have been resolved:

- FIELD DESCRIPTIONS: Missing field descriptions have been added for a large
number of IMDI fields. (#657)

** KNOWN ISSUES **

Among others, the following issues have been described and will be addressed in
future version of Arbil:

- IMPORT RESOURCES: Resources that are protected and require authentication can
currently not be imported into the local corpus since the authentication
mechanism is broken. (#679)

- SHOW IMDI FORMATTED: When showing an IMDI metadata file 'IMDI formatted', the
formatting does not look as expected. (#899)

- PERFORMANCE: After importing (certain) corpus nodes, CPU load gets and stays
high. (#929)

- SEARCH IN TABLE: The layout of the input boxes for search/replcae within a
table sometimes break on Windows and Linux. (#1577)

- REMOTE SEARCH: The search interface for remote search is not very intuitive.
At the moment remote search requires two steps: remote searching and local
filtering. (#651)

- FILE HANDLING: There are some issues with file handling that occur on Windows
7. These can cause opening in external file and moving the local corpus
directory to fail. (#1372 and #1553)
