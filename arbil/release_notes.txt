----------------------------------------

Below is an overview of changes in Arbil since the previous minor version (Arbil 2.3). Where 
applicable, related ticket numbers from TRAC are included at the end of the description.

** ADDITIONS **

The following functionality has been added to Arbil:

- CONTROLLED VOCABULARIES: For controlled vocabularies with distinct values and display
values (e.g. nl -> Netherlands), both are now shown in the drop down in the editor. (#2283)

** CHANGES **

These parts of the Arbil functionality have changed:

- CMDI PROFILES: Only profiles that have actually been selected get downloaded by 
default. (#1412)

- CMDI PROFILES: There is now a button on the Templates and Profiles dialogue to refresh
all selected profiles. (#2185)

- HELP: The help contents have been updated, using the Arbil manual as its source.
Help for both IMDI and CMDI usage is available. (#1937)

- IMPORT/EXPORT: The import/export dialogue has been redesigned. (#1684, #1754)

- CONTROLLED VOCABULARIES: When searching for a value by typing, the shortest match
now gets selected first instead of the first. (#1189)

- TYPECHECKER: A new version of the type checker, which analyses resource files, has been
included. (#1837)

- ADDING MULTIPLE RESOURCES: When adding multiple resources from the working directories
to a session or CMDI file, they get processed together rather than one-by-one
and appear in a single result table instead of one window per file. (#42, #2205)

** FIXES **

Among other, mostly minor, bugfixes, the following issues have been resolved:

- SAVING TO DISK: In particular (rare) instances, saving the XML to disk failed 
resulting in empty document. This was due to a bug in one of the used
libraries. (#1431)

- WINDOWS: The 'Templates and Profiles' and 'Edit IMDI Language List' dialog windows
could grow larger than the available screen space. (#147 and #1584)

- VALIDATION: The IMDI templates have been updated, adding some previously missing
field constraints. (#1686)

- MULTILINGUAL FIELDS: Starting to edit multilingual fields in CMDI metadata could cause
the application to freeze for multiple seconds. This has been greatly improved. (#2190)

- EXPORT FILES: It used to be possible that an export directory contained temporary
files that should not be included. This has been resolved. (#1757)

- ENCODING: Fixed an issue occurring when the path to the Arbil working files on disk
contains non-ASCII characters - this happens for example if there are special characters
in the user name. (#2299)

- AUTO FIELDS: When adding a resource file to an IMDI session, the type and
size of the resource would sometimes not be filled in. Subsequent saving
errors were a related issue. These have been resolved. (#1308 and #2212)

- PERFORMANCE: The application would become slow and would even freeze or crash
during a heavy operation such as searching a large corpus when running as an installed
application on Windows. This was caused by an incorrect memory allocation for the Java
virtual machine and has been resolved. (#1321)

- SIGN LANGUAGE TEMPLATE: The built-in sign language template for IMDI used to have 
controlled vocabulary links that are no longer accessible. These have been updated. (#2550)

- ARBIL FORUM: The Arbil forum has changed to a new location. The link in the 'Help'
menu has been updated to open this new location in a browser. (#2269)

** KNOWN ISSUES **

Among others, the following issues have been described and will be addressed in future version of
Arbil:

- IMPORT RESOURCES: Resources that are protected and require authentication can currently not be
imported into the local corpus since the authentication mechanism is broken. (#679)

- SHOW IMDI FORMATTED: When showing an IMDI metadata file 'IMDI formatted', the formatting does
not look as expected. (#899)

- PERFORMANCE: After importing (certain) corpus nodes, CPU load gets and stays high. (#929)

- SEARCH IN TABLE: The layout of the input boxes for search/replace within a table sometimes break
on Windows and Linux. (#1577)

- REMOTE SEARCH: The search interface for remote search is not very intuitive. At the moment remote
search requires two steps: remote searching and local filtering. (#651)

- FILE HANDLING: There are some issues with file handling that occur on Windows 7. These can cause
opening in external file and moving the local corpus directory to fail. (#1372 and #1553)
