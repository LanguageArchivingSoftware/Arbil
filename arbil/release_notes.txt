** ADDITIONS **

The following functionality has been added to Arbil:

** CHANGES **

These parts of the Arbil functionality have changed:

- FAVOURITES: Favourites are now grouped by type. (#21)

- CMDI PROFILES: Profiles are no longer downloaded automatically along with the
profiles list. They get downloaded as soon as they are selected, or
alternatively all profiles can be downloaded through a new 'Download all
profiles' button in the profiles panel of the templates dialog. (#1412)

- STORAGE DIRECTORY: When multiple storage directories are detected, the user is
notified through a warning dialog. (#1246)

** FIXES **

Among other, mostly minor, bugfixes, the following issues have been resolved:

** KNOWN ISSUES **

Among others, the following issues have been described and will be addressed in
future version of Arbil:

- IMPORT RESOURCES: Resources that are protected and require authentication can
currently not be imported into the local corpus since the authentication
mechanism is broken. (#679)

- SHOW IMDI FORMATTED: When showing an IMDI metadata file 'IMDI formatted', the
formatting does not look as expected. (#899)

- PERFORMANCE: After importing (certain) corpus nodes, CPU load gets and stays
high. (#929)

- SEARCH IN TABLE: The layout of the input boxes for search/replcae within a
table sometimes break on Windows and Linux. (#1577)

- REMOTE SEARCH: The search interface for remote search is not very intuitive.
At the moment remote search requires two steps: remote searching and local
filtering. (#651)

- FILE HANDLING: There are some issues with file handling that occur on Windows
7. These can cause opening in external file and moving the local corpus
directory to fail. (#1372 and #1553)
